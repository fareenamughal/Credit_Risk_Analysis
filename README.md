# Credit_Risk_Analysis
 Module 18: Supervised Machine Learning and Credit Risk

___
 
## Overview
___

The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate the credit worthiness or credit risk of customers. We use different machine learning models to try and predict the credit risk and to determine which model is best suited for evaluating credit risk. 

The models used are as follows:
  - Naïve Random Oversampling
  - SMOTE Oversampling
  - Cluster Centroids Undersampling
  - SMOTEENN combination sampling
  - Balanced Random Forest Classifier
  - Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier

#### Resources

 - Data source is the LoanStats_2019Q1.csv
 - Software is jupyter notebook using python
 
 - Links to the two python/jupyter notebook are as below:
