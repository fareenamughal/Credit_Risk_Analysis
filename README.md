# Credit_Risk_Analysis
 Module 18: Supervised Machine Learning and Credit Risk

___
 
## Overview
___

The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate the credit worthiness or credit risk of customers. We use different machine learning models to try and predict the credit risk and to determine which model is best suited for evaluating credit risk. 

The models used are as follows:
  - Naïve Random Oversampling
  - SMOTE Oversampling
  - Cluster Centroids Undersampling
  - SMOTEENN combination sampling
  - Balanced Random Forest Classifier
  - Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier

#### Resources

 - Data source is the LoanStats_2019Q1.csv
 - Software is jupyter notebook using python

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine
learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
